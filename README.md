# Synapz

Synapz is a peer-to-peer messaging application built in Java. The project is designed to allow communication between a server and multiple clients using basic socket programming. 

## Features

- Simple communication between a server and a client.
- Bidirectional message exchange (client sends a message to the server, and the server replies).
- Can be extended for more advanced features like user authentication, encryption, and multi-client handling.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java 17+** (or any JDK that supports sockets)

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Synapz.git

2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
   
3. Run the Server.java file to start the server.
   
4. Run the Client.java file to connect to the server.

### Usage
